# Android: Getting Started Workshop Series

Welcome! This Gitbook contains a series of resources for Android Design and Android Development Workshops. These resources have been compiled to quickly allow you (or your students) to get up to speed on important Android development concepts.

*Protip:* Bring an Android device and USB cable with you to connect to your computer! We cannot guarantee spares. Without a device you will be unable to test your app without the use of a virtual machine (older laptops may not support virtualization).

During these workshops, you will explore how Android apps are designed. Then, you will learn Android programming concepts using Java. These skills will be combined to build your very own Android app.

## Getting Started

This section contains information about installing Java, Android Studio

## Design Android Apps

This section contains notes, examples, source code, and lesson notes for the **Designing Android Apps Workshop**. This workshop's target audience is anyone with an interest in application development. No prior programming knowledge is required. Some programming concepts will be introduced.

## Android Development with Java

This section contains notes, examples, source code, and more for the **Android Development with Java Workshop**. This workshop's target audience is anyone curious about programming or some programming skills. It is designed to introduce Java as a programing language and environment at a high level while learning enough code to create an interactive application.
