# Installing Java

You will need Java installed on your computer before we can get started. You will need to install both the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Development Kit (JDK).

First, you can download and install Java (which contained the JRE) here: https://java.com/en/download/. This will allow you to run Java on your computer. Beware of them sneaking in 'free' product offers or trials in the installer. You do not need to subscribe to anything extra or 'accept any special offers'.

Next, you'll need to install the JDK. This allows you to develop and test Java software. You can find the **JDK Version 7.x here**: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

Upon Completion, you are ready to move on and *install Android Studio*.

##### Default JDK Installation Locations

These are important to note! Sometimes, you may need to locate the JDK by hand. These are the default installation paths for Windows and OS X (note that the version numbers may differ):

- Mac OS X Location: `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0x.jdk/Contents/Home`
- Windows Location: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0x`
